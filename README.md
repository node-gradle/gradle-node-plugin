* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

The plugin is published in the [Gradle plugins portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.node-gradle.node)

## Building the Plugin

### Prerequisites

Some integration test ensure that this plugin is able to use the globally installed Node.js, npm or yarn tools.
This requires those tools are globally installed on your system in order to get all integration tests pass.

### Command

To build the plugin, just type the following command:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The integration tests are run using multiple Gradle versions to ensure it works on all supported versions.
But this takes a lot of time. To speed up the build, the tests run only on the current Gradle versions.
To run the tests against all Gradle versions, use the following option (it is done by the CI).

```bash
./gradlew build -PtestAllSupportedGradleVersions=true
```
